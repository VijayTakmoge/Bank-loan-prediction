# Bank-loan-prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict loan approvals for banking customers. By implementing a Decision Tree model, the project aims to classify loan eligibility based on customer attributes like income, credit history, and employment status. This model assists financial institutions in making efficient and informed loan approval decisions.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data for accurate modeling.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant variables for improved performance.
Model Training: Building a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn to classify loan eligibility.
Evaluation Metrics: Measuring model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Illustrating the decision-making process of the tree using tree plots.


Achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test dataset.
The decision tree structure provides clear and interpretable rules for loan approvals.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the banking sector, showcasing how decision trees can aid in automating and enhancing the loan approval process.
